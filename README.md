## Description
Piece of Spain is targeted for users  interested in traveling to Spain. The site is full with information about Spain and it displays the bright colors of the Spain flag.

HTML and CSS provide a minimalistic and easy to use site where travelers have easy access to information about different cities in Spain. By the use of flip-cards, users are able to learn interesting facts about Spain. 

JavaScript was used to provide functionality for the sticky navbar, accordion, and carousal. To hear back from users with insightful information, a form was created that uses form validation and regex.
