        <p class="text-panel">Why I'm Famous?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The Sagrada Família is famous for 
          being one of the most iconic examples of Antoni Gaudí's unique style, 
          combining elements of Art Nouveau, Catalan Modernism and Spanish Late Gothic 
          design. The theme of nature figures prominently in Gaudí's design, both in terms 
          of symbolism and the use of organic shapes and forms.

        <p class="paragraph">La Piazzenza is one of the best and most popular Italian 
          restaurants in the city. Known for its big pizzas and cheap prices, La Piazzenza 
          is the perfect place to grab a bite to eat and take a break after walking around the beautiful 
          Gaudi Avenue.
          L’encís (‘The Charm’ in Catalan) is a warm and welcoming restaurant that is definitely worthy of 
          its name. Situated four minutes away from the Sagrada Familia, L’encís offers a great variety of 
          Catalan cuisine as well as good wine.
          Anauco is a gourmet restaurant specializing in hamburgers, and is located one block away from Gaudi’s church. 
          This small and cozy restaurant is one of the most famous places in the area, not only because of its delicious 
          meals but also because of the low prices.

        <p class="paragraph">Casa Mila (1906-1912) is Antoni Gaudi's most iconic work of civic architecture due to 
          both its constructional and functional innovations, as well as its ornamental and decorative solutions. 
          It was Gaudi's last work of civic architecture and represented a break with the conventions of his day.

        <p class="paragraph">With a kitchen that stays open until late, Boca Grande 
          won't leave you outside a closed door after your visit to La Pedrera. Feast 
          on some of the city's freshest fish, and stellar paellas and rice dish – their 
          standouts among other specialities.
          Bar Mut has an ineffably Gallic feel, with its etched glass, bronze fittings, 
          chanteuses on the sound system, and (whisper it) Paris prices. The tapas are undeniably 
          superior, ranging from a carpaccio of sea urchin to fried eggs with foie.
          Designed with the feeling of home in mind, Cafe Emma provides a cosy environment where you 
          can savour simple French dishes. A true bistrot, Cafe Emma offers a daily set lunch menu 
          featuring traditional French meals.

        <p class="paragraph">Park Güell is one of the most popular attractions in Barcelona. 
          The architecture of these buildings is unique and has employed the use of vibrant

          This area is the most popular and most visited section of the park. This area of the park is roped off certain

        <p class="paragraph">About halfway between Park Guell and the Carmel Bunkers (an amazing sunset spot!) you’ll find this 
          traditional, down-home restaurant. Bar Delicias is off the tourist-beaten path and packed with locals more often than not. 
          They’re famous for their huge platters of patatas bravas, but you can’t go wrong with anything you order here.
